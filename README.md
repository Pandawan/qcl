# qcl: Quick Command Line

`qcl` is an addon that works on top of other package managers like npm and yarn.
It keeps track of all globally installed packages and removes those that have passed their expiry date.
This allows you to quickly install temporary packages (or CLIs) without having to worry about uninstalling them.

## TODO

- Make better README with helpful commands
- Make qcl work with local
